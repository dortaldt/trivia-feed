# Duplicate Detector Batching Improvements

## Overview

The hybrid duplicate detector and remover scripts have been enhanced to overcome Supabase's default 1,000 row query limit by implementing intelligent batching.

## Problem

Previously, both scripts would fetch all questions with a single query:

```javascript
const { data: questions, error } = await supabase
  .from('trivia_questions')
  .select('...')
  .order('created_at', { ascending: true });
```

This approach was limited by Supabase's default maximum of 1,000 rows per query, meaning:
- Databases with >1,000 questions would only process the first 1,000
- Duplicate detection was incomplete for larger datasets
- No indication that data was truncated

## Solution

### Batched Fetching Implementation

Both scripts now implement intelligent batching:

1. **Count Total Questions**: First query gets the exact count
2. **Batch Processing**: Fetch questions in 1,000-row chunks using `.range()`
3. **Progress Tracking**: Show batch progress to user
4. **Rate Limiting**: 100ms delay between batches to be database-friendly
5. **Error Handling**: Individual batch error handling with graceful degradation

### Code Changes

#### Before:
```javascript
const { data: questions, error } = await supabase
  .from('trivia_questions')
  .select('id, question_text, answer_choices, correct_answer, topic, subtopic, tags, difficulty, language, created_at')
  .order('created_at', { ascending: true });
```

#### After:
```javascript
// Get total count
const { count: totalCount, error: countError } = await supabase
  .from('trivia_questions')
  .select('*', { count: 'exact', head: true });

// Fetch in batches
const batchSize = 1000;
const allQuestions = [];
let offset = 0;

while (offset < totalCount) {
  const { data: batchQuestions, error: batchError } = await supabase
    .from('trivia_questions')
    .select('id, question_text, answer_choices, correct_answer, topic, subtopic, tags, difficulty, language, created_at')
    .order('created_at', { ascending: true })
    .range(offset, offset + batchSize - 1);
  
  allQuestions.push(...batchQuestions);
  offset += batchSize;
  
  // Rate limiting
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
}
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Complete Dataset Processing**
- No longer limited to first 1,000 questions
- Processes entire database regardless of size
- More accurate duplicate detection

### 2. **Progress Visibility**
- Shows batch progress: "Fetching batch 3/5 (2001-3000 of 4500)..."
- Users can see total question count
- Clear indication of processing status

### 3. **Database-Friendly**
- 100ms delays between batches reduce database load
- Smaller individual queries are more efficient
- Graceful error handling for individual batches

### 4. **Memory Efficient**
- Questions are accumulated incrementally
- No change to existing processing logic
- Same memory footprint as before for final processing

## Files Modified

### 1. `scripts/hybrid_duplicate_detector.js`
- **Function**: `detectDuplicateQuestions()`
- **Change**: Replaced single query with batched fetching
- **Impact**: Can now detect duplicates across entire database

### 2. `scripts/hybrid_duplicate_remover.js`
- **Function**: `removeDuplicateQuestions()`
- **Change**: Replaced single query with batched fetching
- **Impact**: Can now remove duplicates across entire database

## Usage

No changes to script usage - they work exactly the same:

```bash
# Run detector (interactive)
./scripts/run-hybrid-duplicate-detector.sh

# Run remover (automatic)
node scripts/hybrid_duplicate_remover.js
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Small Databases (<1,000 questions)
- **Before**: 1 query
- **After**: 2 queries (count + single batch)
- **Overhead**: Minimal (~100ms)

### Large Databases (>1,000 questions)
- **Before**: Incomplete processing (first 1,000 only)
- **After**: Complete processing with batching
- **Time**: ~100ms per 1,000 questions + processing time

### Example: 5,000 Questions
- **Batches**: 5 batches of 1,000 each
- **Fetch Time**: ~500ms (5 × 100ms delays)
- **Total Time**: Fetch time + processing time (unchanged)

## Error Handling

### Batch-Level Errors
- Individual batch failures don't stop entire process
- Error logging shows which batch failed
- Continues with remaining batches

### Connection Issues
- Count query failure stops process (no point continuing)
- Batch query failures are logged but process continues
- Graceful degradation for partial data

## Future Enhancements

### Configurable Batch Size
Could add environment variable for batch size:
```javascript
const batchSize = process.env.BATCH_SIZE || 1000;
```

### Parallel Batching
For very large databases, could fetch multiple batches in parallel:
```javascript
const batchPromises = [];
for (let i = 0; i < numBatches; i++) {
  batchPromises.push(fetchBatch(i * batchSize));
}
const results = await Promise.all(batchPromises);
```

### Progress Persistence
Could save progress and resume from last batch on interruption.

## Testing

Both scripts have been syntax-validated and maintain backward compatibility:

```bash
# Syntax validation
node -c scripts/hybrid_duplicate_detector.js  # ✓ Pass
node -c scripts/hybrid_duplicate_remover.js   # ✓ Pass
```

## Conclusion

The batching implementation ensures that duplicate detection and removal scripts can handle databases of any size while maintaining the same user experience and processing logic. The changes are transparent to users but provide complete dataset coverage for more accurate duplicate management.
