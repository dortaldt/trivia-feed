# Redux Persistence Test Plan

## Test: Question Answers Persistence and Ring Progress

### Expected Behavior
1. **Before Fix**: Ring progress resets to 0 after app refresh because Redux questions state was not persisted
2. **After Fix**: Ring progress should continue from where it left off after app refresh

### Test Steps

1. **Start the app** and answer some questions correctly in different topics
   - Answer 2-3 questions in "Arts" correctly
   - Answer 1-2 questions in "Geography" correctly  
   - Answer 3-4 questions in "Miscellaneous" correctly

2. **Check ring progress** - should see rings with progress based on correct answers

3. **Refresh the app** (or restart)

4. **Check logs** for:
   ```
   [REDUX PERSIST] Loading questions from storage for user: guest
   [REDUX PERSIST] Successfully loaded X questions from storage
   ```

5. **Check ring progress again** - should maintain the same progress as before refresh

6. **Answer more questions** - ring progress should continue counting up from the preserved state

### Key Log Messages to Watch For

**Success Indicators:**
- `[REDUX PERSIST] Saved X questions to storage` (when answering questions)
- `[REDUX PERSIST] Loaded X questions from storage` (on app start)
- `[RING PROGRESS UPDATE] Topic: Using Redux count X (cached: Y)` (when Redux has new progress)
- `[RING CACHE PRESERVE] Topic: Using cached count X instead of Redux count 0` (should NOT happen after fix)

**Problem Indicators:**
- `[RING CACHE PRESERVE] Topic: Using cached count X instead of Redux count 0` (indicates Redux state is empty)
- No `[REDUX PERSIST]` messages (indicates persistence not working)

### Expected Results
- Ring progress should persist across app refreshes
- New correct answers should continue incrementing from the preserved state
- No more "cache preserve" messages with Redux count 0
