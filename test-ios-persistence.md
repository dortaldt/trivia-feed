# iOS Persistence Fix Test Plan

## Issue Fixed
- **Error**: `[REDUX PERSIST] Error saving questions to storage: [TypeError: Proxy handler is null]`
- **Problem**: Redux state contained Proxy objects that couldn't be serialized on iOS
- **Impact**: Questions weren't being saved to storage, causing rings to reset after app refresh

## Changes Made

### 1. Redux Store Configuration (`src/store/index.ts`)
- Added serialization middleware to handle non-serializable data
- Configured to ignore specific paths that might contain non-serializable objects

### 2. Questions Storage (`src/store/triviaSlice.ts`)
- Updated `saveQuestionsToStorage` with deep cloning before JSON.stringify
- Added fallback manual serialization for iOS compatibility
- Enhanced `safeSyncUserProfile` with robust error handling and manual cloning

### 3. Rings Storage (`src/hooks/useTopicRings.ts`)
- Updated `saveRingsToStorage` with similar iOS-safe serialization
- Added fallback manual serialization for ring data

## Test Steps

### Before Testing
1. Clear app storage: Settings > General > iPhone Storage > [App] > Offload App
2. Reinstall the app fresh

### Test 1: Questions Persistence
1. **Answer questions correctly** in different topics:
   - Answer 2-3 questions in "Science" correctly
   - Answer 1-2 questions in "Mathematics" correctly  
   - Answer 3-4 questions in "Arts" correctly

2. **Check logs** for successful saves:
   ```
   [REDUX PERSIST] Saved X questions to storage
   ```
   Should NOT see:
   ```
   [REDUX PERSIST] Error saving questions to storage: [TypeError: Proxy handler is null]
   ```

3. **Force close and restart app**

4. **Check logs** for successful loads:
   ```
   [REDUX PERSIST] Loading questions from storage for user: guest
   [REDUX PERSIST] Successfully loaded X questions from storage
   ```

5. **Verify ring progress** maintains the same levels as before restart

### Test 2: Ring Progress Persistence
1. **Check ring progress** after answering questions
2. **Force close and restart app**
3. **Verify rings maintain progress** - should see logs like:
   ```
   [RING CACHE PRESERVE] Topic: Using cached count X instead of Redux count 0
   ```
   This indicates the rings are properly preserving cached progress

### Test 3: Continued Progress
1. **Answer more questions** after restart
2. **Verify ring progress continues** from preserved state
3. **Check that new answers increment** the existing progress

## Expected Results
- ✅ No more "Proxy handler is null" errors
- ✅ Questions persist across app restarts
- ✅ Ring progress maintains state after restart
- ✅ New answers continue incrementing from preserved state
- ✅ All storage operations work on iOS

## Success Indicators
- `[REDUX PERSIST] Saved X questions to storage` (no errors)
- `[REDUX PERSIST] Successfully loaded X questions from storage` (on restart)
- Ring progress numbers match before and after restart
- No serialization errors in console

## Failure Indicators
- Any "Proxy handler is null" errors
- Questions count resets to 0 after restart
- Ring progress resets to 0 after restart
- Serialization errors in AsyncStorage operations
