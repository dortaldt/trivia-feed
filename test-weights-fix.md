# Weights Loading Fix Test

## Issue Description
The client was overwriting weights data every new session instead of loading and updating existing weights from the database.

## Root Cause
The `loadUserDataSuccess` reducer in `triviaSlice.ts` had an "ULTRA-CONSERVATIVE" approach that was too aggressive and prevented legitimate weight loading from the database on fresh sessions.

## Fix Applied
Modified the logic in `loadUserDataSuccess` to be smarter about when to preserve local vs database weights:

### Before (Too Conservative)
```typescript
// NEVER overwrite if we have any local activity or non-default weights
if (localHasAnyInteractions || localHasNonDefaultWeights) {
  // This prevented loading database weights even on fresh sessions!
  console.log('[Redux] PRESERVING local profile: has active session data or personalized weights');
  // Keep the existing local profile - do not overwrite
}
```

### After (Smart Logic)
```typescript
// SMART LOGIC: Only preserve local weights if they are personalized AND we have unsaved changes
// This allows loading database weights on fresh sessions while protecting active sessions
if (localHasNonDefaultWeights && hasUnsavedChanges) {
  console.log('[Redux] PRESERVING local profile: has personalized weights with unsaved changes');
  // Keep the existing local profile - do not overwrite
} else {
  // Use database profile in these cases:
  // 1. Local has default weights (fresh session)
  // 2. Local has personalized weights but no unsaved changes (safe to update)
  // 3. No recent activity (fresh session)
  console.log(`[Redux] Using database profile: ${reason}`);
  state.userProfile = profile;
}
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Fresh Session (Should Load from Database)
- Local profile has default weights (0.5)
- No unsaved changes
- **Result**: Load personalized weights from database ✅

### Active Session with Unsaved Changes (Should Preserve Local)
- Local profile has personalized weights (≠ 0.5)
- Has unsaved weight changes or interactions
- **Result**: Preserve local weights to prevent data loss ✅

### Active Session with Saved Changes (Should Update from Database)
- Local profile has personalized weights (≠ 0.5)
- No unsaved changes (all synced)
- **Result**: Safe to update from database ✅

## Test Cases to Verify

1. **Fresh App Start**: User opens app → Should load their personalized weights from database
2. **Mid-Session**: User answers questions → Should preserve local changes until synced
3. **After Sync**: User's changes are synced → Should allow database updates again
4. **Background/Foreground**: App goes to background and returns → Should handle correctly
